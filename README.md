I used Ionic serve and Ionic lab to run and test the code

Fetched data will appear in console log

display application as Mobile Application


I have been working on my own application for the past two year and therefor did not have a need to use API's and therefor my experience with using API's was limited. I came accross a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue and a HTTP header issue and at the time did not know how to resolve and it took me a long time to resolve this issue.

Because i could not load the data i could not properly test the application and build and or change and add where needed, once i had all the data I needed from the API, I had problems displaying the data on the application, I could not resolve this issue.

I used a service to 'get' the specific data.

Because I struggled resolving these problems and with the data not displaying I was unable to show my creative side in the front-end.
